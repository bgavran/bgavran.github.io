<h1 id="my-phd-thesis-is-out">My PhD Thesis is out!</h1>
<p>After four years in the making, it is done. I defended, and finally made public my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13001">thesis</a></p>
<center>
<img src="../images/thesis_long.png" alt="Cover of my PhD thesis" height="400" />

<p>I’m incredibly excited about it.</p>
<p>At 272 pages, my thesis is a mathematical foundation for neural networks which is 1) <em>end-to-end</em>, 2) <em>uniform</em>, and 3) <em>prescriptive</em>. It doesn’t deal with only one aspect of neural networks such as architectures, or backpropagation in isolation. Rather, it also tackles optimisers, weight tying, loss functions and provides a complete picture of supervised learning. This picture is presented in a <em>uniform</em> language: all of the pieces fit together into a coherent whole. This is done without depending on Euclidean spaces, or particulars of the implementation of backpropagation, for instance. Lastly, this framework is not merely descriptive, but it’s a <em>prescriptive</em> one. This means it can be used to implement supervised learning code as-is — as opposed to merely describing specific properties of supervised learning.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I use the language of <em>category theory</em>. Category theory is an incredibly powerful and expressive theory which has in the recent years been used as a unifying force among the scientific disciplines, revealing their commonalities that were previously unknown. I believe it has the potential to provide a structuralist foundation of deep learning, and help advance its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=668&amp;v=x7psGHgatGM&amp;feature=youtu.be">alchemical practices</a> into a rigorous, transparent and a verifiable foundation.</p>

</center>
<p>I’ve put a lot of effort into placing category theory in context of the recent developments in deep learning, but also science as a whole. As such, I hope the introduction of the thesis helps newcomers to category theory understand the nature of its contributions, and the conclusion of the thesis give a sense of the possibilities unlocked by this principled foundation — some of which we’ve explored in our recent paper <a href="https://categoricaldeeplearning.com/">Categorical Deep Learning: An Algebraic Theory of Architectures</a>.</p>
<p>There’s much more to say but for now — go check out the thesis!</p>
<p>And stay tuned fantastic developments around the corner. Monoids, categories, functors, (co)limits and categorical concepts in general were an indespensable tool for myself and many other researchers for getting a deeper understanding of the world. It enabled us to find patterns that are shared across scientific disciplines, but also to be rigorous and verifiable in our endeavours.</p>
<p>Is there a way to enable deep learning systems to reason in such symbolic, and algebraic ways? To generalise, abstract, and find patterns that go beyond a single scientific field, and do so in interpretable and verifiable ways? This is something we’re exploring at <a href="https://symbolica.ai">Symbolica</a>, and we’re starting a categorical deep learning research program of unprecedented size. Stay tuned.</p>
