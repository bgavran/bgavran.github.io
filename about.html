            <p>I am originally from Croatia, where I’ve got my MSc degree in computer science, from the <a href="https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en">Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)</a> in Zagreb, where I was a part of <a href="https://takelab.fer.hr/">TakeLab</a>.</p>
<p>During that time I became interested in understanding how neural networks really work, and how one might implement them based on simple and elegant principles.
I took the initiative to reimplement a number of neural networks from scratch: <a href="https://github.com/bgavran/DNC">Differentiable Neural Computers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bgavran/Improved_WGAN">Generative Adversarial Networks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bgavran/synthetic_gradients">Synthetic Gradients</a>.
I also implemented <a href="https://github.com/bgavran/autodiff">own automatic differentiation framework</a>.</p>
<p>In my penultimate year I took a Haskell course, opening my eyes to the fact that programming need not be different than mathematics.
This coincided with the release of the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10455">Backprop as Functor</a>, which made me aware of the field of category theory.</p>
<p>I was hooked, and wanted to learn more.
I attended the 0th conference on <a href="https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/workshops/">Applied Category Theory</a> and met the wonderful community behind it.
They were extremely welcoming and supportive in my journey to learn.
There I’ve met <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tvI6QCcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Neil Ghani</a> who invited me to do a PhD in Glasgow under his guidance, to learn about category theory, and apply the ideas behind it to deep learning.</p>
<p>During my PhD, I have written a number of <a href="./papers.html">papers</a> exploring the intersection of category theory, machine learning, game theory, and cybernetics, and had a wonderful time in the <a href="http://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/index.html">Mathematically Structured Programming Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk">University of Strathclyde</a> in Glasgow.
I’ve learned a great deal about what mathematics and programming are from people working on cutting edge ideas.</p>
<p>On 21st of September 2023 I defended my PhD thesis <a href="https://www.brunogavranovic.com/posts/2024-03-13-my-thesis-is-out.html">“Fundamental Components of Deep Learning: A category-theoretic approach”</a>, and passed my viva with minor corrections.</p>
<p>In the following months, I joined the company Symbolica AI, where the research I spearheaded defining the field of <a href="https://categoricaldeeplearning.com/">Categorical Deep Learning</a> was accepted into <a href="https://icml.cc/">ICML</a> and was a key signal for the company’s $31m funding round.
Shortly after, I was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7273698639749804032/">fired</a> without warning.
All the key researchers involved in this work were also fired.
This event was covered in a <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2025/02/category_theorists_in_ai.html">blog post</a> by a member of the category theory community, but unfortunately due to contractual obligations I myself am not allowed to discuss it publicly.</p>
<p>Since, I’ve been involved with industry and research on the research programme of <a href="../research_programme.html">provably correct code generation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I founded the company <a href="https://www.coend.ai">Coend</a> building neural networks that generate provably correct code</li>
<li>I’m employed by <a href="https://glaive-research.org/">GLAIVE</a> on the research grant building <a href="https://www.renaissancephilanthropy.org/a-structured-representation-of-tactics-for-machine-assisted-theorem-proving">intermediate language for tactics</a></li>
<li>I’m a research advisor to Google DeepMind, where I am working with the team led by <a href="https://petar-v.com/">Petar Veličković</a></li>
<li>I’m building <a href="https://github.com/bgavran/TensorType">TensorType</a>, a type-safe tensor processsing framework in Idris</li>
</ul>
